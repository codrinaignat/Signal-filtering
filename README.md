# Signal-filtering

I implemented this project during my bachelor's studies, for a discipline called Digital Signal Processing. 
The requirements for this project were:
- generate and graphically represent 2 sinusoidal signals and a square wave signal;
- generate and graphically represent the sum of the 3 signals above;
- represent only 2 time periods of each signal;
- the parameters for each of the 3 signals can be modified from the user interface;
- fs = 10kHz;
- all signals have a duration of 1 sec;
- 4 types of filters are implemented: LPF, HPF, BPF, BSF;
- the filter order can be modified by the user from the user interface;
- the filtered signal must be shown in frequency and time domain;
- the audio unfiltered and filtered signal spectrum must be represented;
- the GUI must have a button to play the original signal and a button to play the filtered signal.

The file "Proiect.m" contains the Matlab code for the implemented requirements; the "Proiect.fig" is the graphical user interface which is active when the .m file is executed. 
The "SemnalDistorsionat.wav" file contains a small piece of music with noise. Its purpose is didactic. 
The user interface indications are in Romanian but you can send me an email if you have any trouble understanding and you need any help.
